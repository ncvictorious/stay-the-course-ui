# Stay the Course – AI for Education (Dashboard UI)

**React + Tailwind CSS dashboard prototype**  
Visualization layer for the *Stay the Course* AI Early Warning System.

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains the **front-end interface** for the *Stay the Course* project — designed to visualize student-risk analytics generated by the backend AI model.

The dashboard allows educators to view:
- Real-time risk summaries  
- Improved risk profiles  
- Academic trend visualizations  
- Student performance insights  

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> This current UI build serves as a *functional placeholder* and proof of concept.  
> The structure and visuals were implemented to demonstrate the data pipeline and analytics flow while awaiting the dedicated front-end/UI specialist for refinement and deployment.
